        <p>
        I picked up fishing when I was in College a couple years ago. Since coming over to Western Washington, I have discovered plenty of places that I could catch different species of fish which are not present in my home country. I have been to different lakes, ponds as well as rivers and plan to go on more trips as I enjoy discovering new places.

        <p>I try to target Salmon when they are in season but I enjoy fishing for other species as well. I have caught trout, large mouth bass, bluegill, perch. These fishes are located in different bodies of water and different rigs are needed to catch them. Which types of fishes would you like to know more about? </p>
