    <p>There are still a couple of species in the Salmonid family that I have yet to catch. I am hoping to be able to venture out into different states or countries and catch all seven Salmonids as well as other species of fishes in the near future. Where should I go?  </p>

        Alaskan Fishing Trip
    </h2>

    <p>
        There are plenty of fishing opportunities in <b>Alaska</b>. From Saltwater to Freshwater, huge Chinook Salmon, Halibut, Rockfish, Dolly Varden are all examples of species that reside in Alaska. It is however costly to buy air tickets, rent charter boats or hire guides. The costs would eventually add up to a huge sum.

    <h2>Columbia River</h2>

    <p>
        The <b>Columbia River</b> is renowned for its salmon and steelhead runs. In a year of good returns, over 1 million Chinook, coho and sockeye salmon, and summer steelhead travel up the river to spawn in its tributaries. Less known are the river's excellent smallmouth bass and walleye fisheries. One of the species I'm hoping to cross off the list is a <b>Steelhead</b> and these big ocean-going rainbow trout arrive in two major runs but are present in the river all year long.
