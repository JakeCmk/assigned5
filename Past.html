    <p>I try to target Salmon when they are in season but I enjoy fishing for other species as well. I have caught trout, large mouth bass, bluegill, perch. These fishes are located in different bodies of water and different rigs are needed to catch them. Which types of fishes would you like to know more about? </p>
